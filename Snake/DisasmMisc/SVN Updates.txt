Snake MD - Milestone 3
----------------------

Shortly after the second milestone, I decided to do the border. I started it, suddenly no longer had any desire, and stayed away from this game for almost an entire month (in which I programmed tools to download porn :V). Today I returned and finished everything, so I could ship the update on the same day.

Anyway, changes include:
- Added a fully 'functional' screen border.
- Added a counter, showing how much pieces of food you ate so far.
- Changed the control behavior, to only allow one control change per frame.
- The game is now freezing on game over, rather than just restarting.
- Cleaned up the folder a bit. Also added first new subfolder (Weeeee~).

AND I FUCKING HATE WORKING WITH ART ON THE MEGA DRIVE!
