                          SonED2 E02 Level Exporting

E02 is a scriptable, multi-purpose 2D game engine that is also available
from Organized Chaos. It can be used to create games like Sonic the
Hedgehog, or any other type of 2D game. This utility is available for
simultaneously developing custom Sonic the Hedgehog levels for Genesis
and for PC

Any normal gameplay level layout may be exported as an E02 level file,
complete with all solidity in-tact, and all planes separated accordingly.
The level generated will contain 4 planes in this order:

0 - Plane B Low
1 - Plane A Low
2 - Plane B High
3 - Plane A High

Also, for Sonic 1 type levels, the "loop" Chunk must be selected manually
by selecting it as the current Chunk before exporting the level. This
will identify the Chunk as a "loop" and generate the appropriate paths in
the E02 level.

If exporting a level that uses the same art as a previously-exported level,
the "Use existing tiles" option can be used instead of the "Create E02
Level" option to first select an existing E02 tile file. The existing tiles
will be used to build the level loaded in SonED2 when available, and any
new tiles will be added to the file.

The files generated by these options are:

E02Out.lev - The level file
E02Out.til - The tile file
