To-Do:
- Finishing Overworld:
	- Finding a good solution to display level names over tubes.
	- Rewrite story, since a lot doesn't make sense with the overworld anymore.
	- Be able to go back to the overworld once you enter a level, maybe by using a giant ring again.

- Find new music for Night Hill Zone.
- For the release, remove the level select and debug mode.
- There are some ugly pixels on the level select font.
- Finishing SRAM support.
- Finding new Title Screen background art.
- Getting "Don't allow Sonic to leave the screen" on Crabmeat boss to work (right now it's like, either prevent the screen going too far bug or going out of screen >_>).

Bugs:
- Restore music after death, if it isn't the normal music.

Would be great:
- Change Options Screen's text arrays into ASCII arrays. Reading bytes sucks.
- Find a more accurate system for the palette-restoration from WhiteFlash.

Ideas:
- Blood impact when being hit
- Combining GHZ 1 and 3 (and I mean combining, not act transition!)
- Challenge: Race against Sonic's shadow (i.e. Rayman - Candy Chateau)
- Demo Mode (Basically a walkthrough, but in the game itself.)
- Pre-Credits Text (See "Credits.txt")
- Add explosions to the title screen
- Easy Mode with "Hard Part Skipper"
- Making a serious game. That means: Turn cheats off (except Air-Move on B), remove all non-main levels, etc...
