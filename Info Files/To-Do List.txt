To-Do:
- The Star Light Update:
	- Finish post-boss area (where the gravity thing is).
	- Fix graphical problems with the Eggman/Bomb cutscene machine:
		- Fix palette rotation issues. I disabled it for now. (I can't simply disable it altogether, since the conveyor belts use it as well). 
		- Animate the machine (I will need Markey for that once again).
	- Get new songs for:
		- Bomb Boss
		- Post-boss area

- (Re)write most of the embarrasing story texts and maybe redo its entire art to be more appealing. Also increase its speed.
