To-Do:
- Finishing Overworld:
	- Finding a good solution to display level names over tubes.
	- Rewrite story, since a lot doesn't make sense with the overworld anymore.
	- Be able to go back to the overworld once you enter a level, maybe by using a giant ring again.

- Find new music for Night Hill Zone.
- Finding new Title Screen background art.
- Find a new option (right now it's marked as XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX in the options screen and does nothing).
- Fix LZ camera and don't allow to go back when you touch a lamppost.
- Finish the Chapter/Info-Screen stuff.
- Add a sound test, maybe a custom game mode, maybe just included in the options screen.

Bugs:
  Right now I don't know any...

Would be great:
- Find a more accurate system for the palette-restoration from WhiteFlash.
- For Camera Shaking I used an object... WHAT THE HELL WAS IT THINKING???

Ideas:
- Blood impact when being hit.
- Challenge: Race against Sonic's shadow. (i.e. Rayman - Candy Chateau)
- Demo Mode. (Basically a walkthrough, but in the game itself.)
- Pre-Credits Text. (See "Credits.txt")
- Add explosions to the title screen.
- Easy Mode with "Hard Part Skipper".
