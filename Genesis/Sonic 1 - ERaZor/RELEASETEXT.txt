Stop me if you've heard this one before: "Final version of Sonic ERaZor"

Yeah, we're beating that dead horse once more, though this time it's at least been a while – 8 years since the last release, to be precise. Don't get me wrong, I really do mean I originally had no plans to work on it again. Hell, [URL='https://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?threads/sonic-erazor-source-code-and-everything-else.41682/']I even made the source code public[/URL]. But then something happened. That's right, [URL='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaIDlHM3qC4']redhotsonic happened[/URL]. While I did spot the odd bug or design quirk here and there over the past few years already, it was his video – specifically the showcase of a massive, unavoidable hard crash if the game ran without SRAM – that finally made me break my oath. So, uh, thanks? :v:

But after almost a decade of silence, I didn't want to release a new version only containing a single bug fix. One thing led to another and suddenly this revival thingy grew into its own beast. A lovely beast, though; I haven't been this excited about anything tech-related in actual ages. It is unironically a great feeling to look at the clock and see it's already 3 a.m. because I got so lost in the zone while working on something I'm passionate about. I missed that feeling.

If there's anything you might want to take away from this sappy ramble, it's this: don't worry about dusting off the ol' reliable. If working on it makes you happy, that's all that matters. This isn't a goddamn job, it's a passion project. There's nothing to this hobby other than personal gratification and it took me way too long to learn that lesson.
