To-Do:
- The Star Light Update:
	- Find a concept and implement it (easier said than done). (Update: Concept (sorta) found!)
	- Find a proper name for the stage, create the sign, write the new story text, and create the new chapter screen.
	- Finish the new Eggman/Bomb cutscene.
	
- Finish Tutorial Level by creating the info boxes (see Intro Script.txt).

- Rewrite most of the embarrasing story texts and maybe redo its entire art to be more appealing. Also increase its speed.
