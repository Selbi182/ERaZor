Sonic ERaZor 7 - To-Do List
---------------------------

Improvements (gameplay):
	Somehow make the existence of the options menu more apparent for new players
	Some hidden message depending on death counter after finishing the game?
	Make boss HP counter shake on hit
	Make inhuman bullets fire downwards by default (cause who needs anything else anyway?)
	Mystery Dungeon style personality test to set the default options? idk probably stupid and too much work
	Use the terrible title screen music from the 2010 ERaZor release for the =P monitor in LZ and adjust timing
	Start Sonic one chunk closer to the boss every time he dies in FZ (to save time)

Improvements (art):
	Make ERaZor banner focus on the ERZ at all times
	Make water in LZ flooding section a different palette or something to visualize that it isn't breathable anymore (then revert on collecting sign post)
	Fancy new background deformation for Finalor's new background art (similar to SLZ)
	Use square goal blocks for Casual mode (if we can't fix the hitbox)

Casual/Frantic:
	A new difficulty setting Casual/Frantic that reflects all the big gameplay changes between the old and new version
	Casual:
		All ring-based challenges are disabled (Ruined Place inhuman section, etc.)
		Add the ability to stop Sonic from moving in Unreal Place when pressing any of ABC
		Second emerald in Unreal Place doesn't need to be collected without touching the walls anymore (e.g. the first one doesn't respawn when touching a wall)
		Use the new gravity control for Star Agony Place
		Make Star Agony bomb shrapnels around the P-monitor predictable instead of random
		Only lose 10 instead of 20 rings on hit
		Timer counts one second at normal speed
	Frantic:
		All ring-based challenges return, same way as they were in the 2016 release
		Use the old gravity inversion controls for Star Agony Place
		Use sine-wave background for text screens only in Frantic mode (still requires photosensitive mode to be disables)
		Perhaps only unlock Blackout Challenge door when completing the game in Frantic mode?
		Timer counts one second at twice the speed (like it is now)

Bugs:
	Fix cinematic HUD causing garbled explosions from title card graphics in GHZ2
	Fix the garbled art when starting Star Agony
	Fix speed adjustments in intro cutscene and ending sequence
	Fix DPLC when pausing game (see Peelout)
	Disable stage quitting in special stages during start of level and collecting the final emerald (glitchy art)
	Fix underwater palette not turning gray when dying or pausing
	Fix LZ platforms sometimes spawning multiple times
	Fix bomb machine cutscene not loading graphics in time in cinematic mode
	Fix title cards being broken on more advanced emulators (see LZ)
	Fix LZ flooding not counting as underwater while Sonic is on the ground
	Fix garbled art after SLZ easter egg and the HUD being shown during it
	Fix MZ background disappearing when teleporting too many times
	Fix the issue of LZ walling you off sometimes
	Fix Crabmeat boss during cinematic HUD getting the white stuck
	Fix falling through geometry when rolling along non-activated wires in Star Agony while nonstop inhuman
	Fix music voices being corrupted after the special stage finish jingle

Misc:
	Reduced flashing lights option (currently WIP)
	Tidy up sound test music order

Hardware Testing:
	Fix weird lock when exiting special stages via pause (might already be fixed, needs hardware testing)
	Fix crash on time over (might be fixed, needs hardware testing)
	Fix remaining no-SRAM bugs (technically done, but will need proper testing once I get the cartridge)

---------------------------

	Bug Reports from YouTube:
		The only other bug I encountered was the slowdown/cram dot bug on rhs’ livestream of the game with the crabmeat in ghz.
		If you leave the exploding projectiles it shoots on screen long enough it will happen. I could reproduce it on real hw, regen, and Kega. 

		Btw I recently played your hack on my everdrive pro & had an issue in that water level with the camera.
		For some reason after the first checkpoint where you’re supposed to fall down, I kept dying because the camera wasn’t scrolling down fast enough I think.
		The only way I was able to fix it was by resetting back to my everdrive’s menu & booting it up again. It was kinda bizzare. Besides that I didn’t have any other issues besides the ones RHS mentioned.
	
		I also encountered another a bug with the same text screen (and this bug also happens in the tutorial with the text boxes) whilst doing an experimental TAS run.
		The bug results in things such as graphical corruption, temporarily hanging and crashing. It's triggered by spamming start as fast as possible or in terms of TASing every 2 or 4 frames.
		I'm guessing this is also overflow related and the game not taking account for button spam and not checking if the ID has already reached set a point on time.
		So yeah, my suggestion would be either add some kind of delay (that can't be bypassed) before the button press is registered or somehow make so it caps using a equal to or greater than check if needed,
		when a counter reaches the point where it's suppose to transition\finish and trigger the said transition\finish.
		However it would be nice if you could add the option turn off the story elements and text screens but that's up to you.
