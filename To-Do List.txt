To-Do:
- Finishing Overworld:
	- Finding a good solution to display level names over tubes.
	- Rewrite story, since a lot doesn't make sense with the overworld anymore.
	- Be able to go back to the overworld once you enter a level, maybe by using a giant ring again.

- Find new music for Night Hill Zone.
- For the release, remove the debug mode.
- There are some ugly pixels on the level select font which need to be removed.
- Finding new Title Screen background art.
- Finishing combination of GHZ 1 and 3.
- Find 2 new options, which will replace debug mode and invin time.
- Fix LZ camera and don't allow to go back when you touch a lamppost.
- Finish the Chapter/Info Screen stuff.

Bugs:
- Restore music after death, if it isn't the normal music.

Would be great:
- Change Options Screen's text arrays into ASCII arrays. Reading bytes sucks.
- Find a more accurate system for the palette-restoration from WhiteFlash.

Ideas:
- Blood impact when being hit.
- Challenge: Race against Sonic's shadow. (i.e. Rayman - Candy Chateau)
- Demo Mode. (Basically a walkthrough, but in the game itself.)
- Pre-Credits Text. (See "Credits.txt")
- Add explosions to the title screen.
- Easy Mode with "Hard Part Skipper".
