[quote name='Selbi on the development of Sonic ERaZor'][i]"Months of sleepless nights, lots of raging and realising how much it sucks to fuck up your source, forcing you to use a damn old backup, resulting into instant rage-quit for  several weeks, returning, fucking something up again, rage-quiting again, returning..."[/i][/quote]
That quote would pretty much sum up everything you need to know for the development of the third public release of my hack: Sonic ERaZor

It's been over a year since the last release, but the waiting really had its reasons: I'm too weak. If I fail at something, I will stop working for several days/weeks. In total, I probably only worked on this for 3 months, rather than 12. I only worked on it every here and then, but not constantly.
This game had so many updates, feature additions and clean up, that it doesn't really count as an update anymore, but should already be a seperate category, maybe "semi-remake".


But enough of the boring history. Sonic ERaZor, unlike other "famous" hacks, doesn't follow the unwritten guidelines of hacking, it has its own rule (notice the lack of "s"): Go wild. That's right, anything you see in this hack was just a random thought of my mind, giving no fuck if it would be a good idea or not. This might result many people into thinking "Was this guy on crack?", and to answer your question, no, I just eat a lot of bubble gum.

You could also say, as somebody on IRC said:
[quote][i]"This hack can be described as the big fat flaming middle finger of Sonic Hacks... I love it!"[/i][/quote]

The difficulty, as you might remember it from the other two versions, has been reduced by a lot. This is due to a lot of gameplay tweaks, which weren't just necessary to please the testers, but also because I realized how stupid my design and gameplay choices were. This, however, does not make this hack easy at all. Expect some frustration!


And here, have some screenshots:

[i]Title Screen[/i] - I know what you are thinking after looking at Sonic. No need to tell me.
[i]Options Screen[/i] - This had a LOOOT of design changes during development and I think this is the thing I spent most of my time on.
[i]Story Screen[/i] - Unlike the Options Screen, this thing never really changed during development and was perfect from the first minute on.
[i]Spring Yard Place[/i] - The overworld, where you can access the options menu, re-watch the intro cutscene and of course select your level.
[i]Night Hill Place[/i] - While it had some design changes as well, it's pretty much excactly like the previous release and close to nothing changed.
[i]Green Hill Place[/i] - This takes place right after Night Hill Place and is based off the original Green Hill Zone, with only one exception: Explosions, lots of them.
[i]Special Place[/i] - The infamous rage-machine is back, but this time not as tough, thanks to many tweaks, including Mercury's physics fix and the addition of checkpoints.
[i]Ruined Place[/i] - As if the Special Stage wasn't enough, the latter part of this level will make your hairs grow faster, though the spikes will only teleport you, rather than insta-kill you.
[i]Labyrinth Place[/i] - I kept the original name for one simple reason: This actually IS a labyrinth. For unexperienced people worse than Ruined Place. (Hint: Rings are bad, no rings are good, 1-Ups are really bad.)
[i]Finalor Place[/i] - The name makes as much sense as the stage, none. Just expect to get crushed by giant stumpers while being shocked by exploding energy balls.


As with all hacks, posting a complete list of feature updates is close to impossible and stupid, so I will just briefly list the, in my opinion, most important updates:[list]
[*]New title screen
[*]A tube-based overworld
[*]An options screen
[*]SRAM to save your progress and stats
[*]New HUD and customized title cards
[*]A story screen
[*]Seperated in chapters
[*]And more, WAAAYYY more stuff and bug fixes, lots of bug fixes
[/list]
I'd like to give special thanks to everyone who helped me along the way of creating this project:[list]
[*]MarkeyJester
[*]DalekSam
[*]SOTI
[*]EduardoKnuckles
[*]Any person who created a tool or guide that I used in this hack
[*]And the rest of the #SSRG IRC chat on BadnikNET
[/list]
There are probably more, but I don't remember them all. If I forgot somebody, just hit me up and I'll add you.

And one final note I'd like to give out to everyone: This is a really short hack. Average skilled Sonic game players shouldn't take more than 20 minutes to finish this hack completely, so I'm kindly asking you to play through it entirly.
