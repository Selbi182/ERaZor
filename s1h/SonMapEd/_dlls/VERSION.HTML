<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>KENS V1.4 RC3<br>
* Corrected a bug that prevented the functions that output data to a buffer to 
create the buffer (could only use already initialized buffers). Thanks a LOT to 
Korama for helping me fixing this.<br>
* Fixed all the compression functions so they produce files with an even size<br>
* Included the Delphi unit corrected by Korama (my changes to this unit were not 
really good - I'm not a Delphi programmer)<br>
* Headers and units are now in a sub-directory named &quot;Include&quot;<br>
* Updated the info in the README.HTML file</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>KENS V1.4 RC2<br>
* Turned all functions to local functions, so they all use temporary files<br>
* Removed the temporary local Kosinski functions (as the original functions are 
now local)<br>
* Added functions that output data to a buffer rather than to a file (thanks to 
Stealth for asking for
that improvement)<br>
* Edited the headers and units to reflect the changes<br>
* Converted README.TXT, VERSION.TXT and LICENSE.TXT to HTML, because it's easier to read<br>
* Updated the info in the README.HTML file</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>KENS V1.4 RC1<br>
* Corrected a bug in the Enigma Decompression algorithm. Thanks to Stealth for 
reporting and Nemesis
for helping in fixing it.<br>
* Added &quot;Local&quot; Kosinski functions, which copy the file to the Windows temporary 
directory before
compressing or decompressing. This fixes a speed issue when the source or 
destination files are on a
remote computer. Thanks to Stealth for finding out this issue (we spent hours 
trying to find out why
it was so slow) and helping in fixing it (although I used a different method 
from the one used in
the unofficial version that he released).<br>
* Edited the headers and units to reflect the changes in the Kosinski functions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>KENS V1.3<br>
* Corrected a bug in the Game Maker wrapper functions. That bug prevented to use 
the decompression
functions.<br>
* Added the Sonic 2 Sound Driver support to the Saxman compressor and 
decompressor<br>
* Edited the headers and units to reflect the changes in the Saxman functions<br>
* Changed the info about the Saxman compression tools in the README.TXT file<br>
* Radically changed the copyright texts in the sources, so everybody who 
participated to the KENS
Project is recognized for his work</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>KENS V1.2<br>
* Added Game Maker wrapper functions, so that Game Maker users are able to use 
the KENS library<br>
* Completed the README.TXT file with info for Game Maker users</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>KENS V1.1<br>
* Corrected a bug in the Moduled Kosinski compression algorithm (thanks to 
rika_chou for reporting it,
thanks to Esrael for giving a hint on how to correct it)<br>
* Updated the Enigma decompressor with the last version of the algorithm kindly 
provided by Nemesis<br>
* Added the Delphi Unit made by Korama (amarokorama@msn.com), so Delphi 
programmers can Dynamic Link
to the KENS library<br>
* Added a KENS.h file that groups the Kosinski.h, Enigma.h, Nemesis.h and 
Saxman.h C++ header files<br>
* Added some more info in the README.TXT file</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>KENS V1.0a<br>
* Just some size improvements</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>KENS V1.0<br>
* Initial Release</p>
