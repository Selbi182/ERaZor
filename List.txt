To-Do:
- Finding a new font for the credits.
- Finding new music for Night Hill Place.
- Finishing Hard Part Skipper.
- Doing a Tutorial/Demo Mode. (Basically a walkthrough, but in the game itself. Actually, I already started working on this, but the gay demo mode system only does shit. -._-.)

Bugs:
- The Sonic 3 animations look weird sometimes.

Would be great:
- For Camera Shaking I used an object... WHAT THE HELL WAS I THINKING??? This should be replaced by something... normal.
