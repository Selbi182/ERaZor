Sonic ERaZor 7 - To-Do List
---------------------------

Improvements (art):
	Make water in LZ flooding section a different palette or something to visualize that it isn't breathable anymore (then revert on collecting sign post)
	New intro animation for Options Menu using H-scroll or something
	Replace RGB sinewave background with starfield (fuzzy)

Casual/Frantic:
	A new difficulty setting Casual/Frantic that reflects all the big gameplay changes between the old and new version
	Casual:
		All ring-based challenges are disabled (Ruined Place inhuman section, etc.)
		Add the ability to stop Sonic from moving in Unreal Place when pressing any of ABC
		Use square GOAL blocks for Casual mode (if we can't fix the hitbox)
		Second emerald in Unreal Place doesn't need to be collected without touching the walls anymore (e.g. the first one doesn't respawn when touching a wall)
		Use the new gravity control for Star Agony Place
		Make Star Agony bomb shrapnels around the P-monitor predictable instead of random
		Only lose 10 instead of 20 rings on hit
		Timer counts one second at normal speed
	Frantic:
		All ring-based challenges return, same way as they were in the 2016 release
		Use the old gravity inversion controls for Star Agony Place
		Use sine-wave background for text screens only in Frantic mode (still requires photosensitive mode to be disables)
		Perhaps only unlock Blackout Challenge door when completing the game in Frantic mode?
		Timer counts one second at twice the speed (like it is now)
