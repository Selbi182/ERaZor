To-Do (MUST be done in order to release this hack):
- Finding a new font for the credits.
- Make all songs being in the same style (in terms of loudness, voices, etc.).
- Finishing Hard Part Skipper (Finding art for it and a good point where to put it in Labyrinth Zone, since that level is ridiculous hard 99% of the time).

Bugs:
- The angeled Sonic 3 running animations look weird.

Would be great:
- Doing a Tutorial/Demo Mode. (Basically a walkthrough, but in the game itself. Actually, I already started working on this, but the gay demo mode system only does shit. -._-.)
