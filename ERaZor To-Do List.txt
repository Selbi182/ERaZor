To-Do:
- Finishing Overworld:
	- It only works untill you unlock Marble Zone. I was too lazy to do the rest for now.
	- Finding a good solution to display level names over tubes.
	- Use giant rings as entrance and teleporters to the levels.
	- Find art for the doors.
	- Rewrite story, since a lot doesn't make sense with the overworld anymore.

- Change Options Screen's text arrays into ASCII arrays. Reading bytes sucks.
- Find new music for Night Hill Zone.

Bugs:
- Restore music after death, if it isn't the normal music.

Would be great:
- Find a more accurate system for the palette-restoration from WhiteFlash.
- Find better graphics for the title screen background.

Ideas:
- Combining GHZ 1 and 3 (combining, not act transition!)
- Challenge: Race against Sonic's shadow (i.e. Rayman - Candy Chateau)
- Demo Mode (Basically a walkthrough, but in the game itself.)
- Pre-Credits Text (See "Credits.txt")
- Add explosions to the title screen
- Easy Mode with "Hard Part Skipper"
- Making a serious game. That means: Turn cheats off (except Air-Move on B), remove all non-main level, etc...
