To-Do:
- The Star Light Update:
	- Find a concept and implant it (easier said than done).
	- Find a proper name for the stage, create the sign, write the new story text, and create the new chapter screen.

- Rewrite most of the embarrasing story texts and maybe redo its entire art to be more appealing. Also increase its speed.
- Work a little on the credits again (slowdown and new font).
- Redesign "Finalor Place" to at least get rid of that grey background in the boss area. Making it longer wouldn't harm either.
- A new life icon. That crazed Sonic is really starting to piss me off.

- Create a straight version of the finished product if necessary (or even combine both).


Ideas:
- Turorial level (see Intro Script.txt)
- Hardening GHZ boss by releasing the balls after a certain amount of hits.
- More cutscenes. One will be when Eggman creates the new bomb (see CutsceneConcept.png).
- Adding a second special stage. I can use my old unfinished one as a sample.
- The S-Monitor should get a new level that solely is made for it (in a positive way, so completely unlike to Ruined Place).
- Adding an end-game easter egg. I tend towards making a "Retro Mode", which basically removes any drums and makes the entire palette grey.
