To-Do (MUST be done in order to release this hack):
- Finishing MZ's foreground art.
- Finding a new font for the credits.
- Add Fail-O-Meter to Hard Part Skipper.

Bugs:
- The angeled Sonic 3 running animations look weird.

Would be great:
- Doing a Tutorial/Demo Mode. (Basically a walkthrough, but in the game itself. Actually, I already started working on this, but the gay demo mode system only does shit. -._-.)
