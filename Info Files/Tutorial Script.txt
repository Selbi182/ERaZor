*Before the screen fades in there's just a black screen with the bottom box and no music:*
	"Hello, and welcome to Sonic ERaZor, the craziest journey you will ever take with a blue hedgehog!
	I know you want to dive right into the action and get yourself slain by {insert fitting definition here}, but before you do so, there are a few things you should know:
	Sonic ERaZor is not based on simply finding a way through the level and going from A to B, but also involves unique and completely wicked challenges, most of them somehow related to explosions.
	But more importantly, there are a few mechanics you should get yourself comfortable with before you actually need them!"

*Screen fades in and a big tutorial level starts:*
	Box 1 - The Controls:
	"To control Sonic, use the (D-Pad) to move and the (C) or (B) button to jump. On the ground, Sonic is able to perform a Spindash by pressing Down+(C), and a Super Peel Out by pressing Up+(C). In mid-air you may perform a Jumpdash/Homing Attack by pressing (C), a Double Jump by pressing (B) or (C)+Up, and a Down Dash by pressing (B)+Down or (C)+Down.
	  -> Play a little around and reach the next room to continue! (You will need the Double Jump and the Super Peel Out.)"

	Box 2 - S-Monitor:
	"This monitor makes Sonic completely invincible, even from things like bottomless pits or being crushed! Additionally, by pressing (A) you can shoot a small bullet in front of you which, upon touching, propels you in the air. Hold down any button on your (D-Pad) to control the direction of your bullet. For example, press Down+(A) to shoot one below you, allowing you to fly upwards!
	  -> Have a little fly around and find another S-Monitor, hidden somewhere in the upper part of this room, to continue!"
	  
	Box 3 - S-Monitor (2):
	"This S-Monitor is different. While you still become invincible and may still fire propelling bullets, you will lose all of your other movement abilities except jumping. Additionally, you will slowly lose rings (faster when you're on the ground) until you die. These are very rare and you shouldn't find many of them, as they usually only appear in very, very old places.
	  -> Get through that narrow spot to continue! Normally you'd have to hurry up before your rings runs out, but for the sake of this tutorial we just cut that out."

	Box 4 - Hard Part Skipper:
	"Some challenges may be too tough for you. Instead of finding your last hopes in cheating, you can just use a Hard Part Skipper! These will automatically be enabled once you fail at a certain challenge for at least 5 times. Once it's enabled (which will be indicated by a sound), just position yourself in front of it and press A+B+C at the same time to skip the part. At the cost of that you will lose all your rings and not feel fully satisfied, but at least you can continue playing. This also works for Special Stages, although you can perform this move at any time; simply press A+B+C. However, this ability will only be accessible after failing 20 times there.
	  -> Try it by skipping that impossible tube to continue!"

	Box 5 - Trial-And-Error:
	"Some parts may require you to dive straight into the action and take any risks in order to find the correct solution for a puzzle. Don't be afraid, there is no real game over!
	  -> Find a way through that room to continue!"


*This final box is in the same room as the exit.*
	Box 6 - Conclusion:
	"And that concludes the tutorial. You should now be able to figure the rest out on your own. Have fun with Sonic ERaZor! I hope you will have as much fun as I had creating it!
	~Selbi (They call me the Michael Bay of Sonic Hacking.)"


*The player enters the exit and the opening cutscene starts.*
