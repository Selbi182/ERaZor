To-Do:
- The Star Light Update:
	- Finish post-boss area (where the gravity thing is).
	- Create art for the machine in the Eggman/Bomb cutscene.
	- Get new songs for:
		- Bomb Boss
		- Post-boss area

- (Re)write most of the embarrasing story texts and maybe redo its entire art to be more appealing. Also increase its speed.
