# Sonic ERaZor souce code (and everything else)
This is an archive of every project I've ever worked on for the Sonic hacking community, be it ROM hacks or tools. Most of you are probably here for the source code of Sonic ERaZor though, which is also included.

Do note that a lot of what you see here is incredibly outdated and/or poorly written to begin with. You have been warned. Apart from that you are free to do whatever you want with this stuff. All I ask for is that you refrain from taking any music, as that was all done by other (way more talented) people.

Also don't steal without giving credits lol
