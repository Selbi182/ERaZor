GIVE YOU A
LITTLE TREAT.

HILL ZONE.

GREAT DAY!
THE SUN IS
SHINING BRIGHT
AND THERE'S NO
BADNIK IN

WHAT COULD
POSSIBLY BE
WRONG WITH
THIS LOVELY
SCENERY?

BUT FEAR NOT!

IMAGINED IT!


*monitor* *screen locks in monitor's center*

*warp sound* *GHZ 2 to normal*

*game freezes*
LOADING EXPLOSIONS...

*game unfreezes* *shows a single tiny explosion in the top right corner*

*controls are locked* *sonic stares up at the explosion, then at the player*

*game freezes again*

OH WOOPS,
THIS WASN'T
SUPPOSED TO
HAPPEN...

OKAY, THAT'S
A LIE, AS
EVERYTHING

DELIBERATE
BUT...

You know what's gay? Sonic 1. It sucks. It sucks so hard that merely looking at a screenshot makes me wanna puke. Time to finally fix that after over two decades.

Usually people write introductions in their show-off topics, but I've taken the liberty to put that into the actual hack.

Hey G! Just a something I've been working on in the past few days that might interest you:

I strongly suggest that you play this blind, should you decide to make a showcase of it.
