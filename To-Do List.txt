To-Do:
- The Star Light Update:
	- Find a concept and implent it (easier said than done).
	- Find a proper name for the stage, create the sign, write the new story text, create the new chapter screen, and make an "Act 7" art.

- Rewrite most of the embarrasing story texts and maybe redo its entire art to be more appealing. Also increase its speed.
- Work a little on the credits again (slowdown and new font).
- Redesign "Finalor Place" to at least get rid of that grey background in the boss area. Making it longer wouldn't harm though.

- Create a straight version of the finished product (or even combine both).


Bugs:
- Fix the "2 Crameats on Spindash" bug.
