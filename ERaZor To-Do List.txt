To-Do:
- Finishing Overworld (find a good solution to display level names)

Bugs:
- Restore music after death, if it isn't the normal music

Would be great:
- Find an more accurate system for the palette-restoration from WhiteFlash
- Find better graphics for the title screen

Ideas:
- Combining GHZ 1 and 3 (combining, not act transition!)
- Hiding Buzz Bombers behind the waterfall in GHZ1
- Challenge: Race against Sonic's shadow (i.e. Rayman - Candy Chateau)
- Demo Mode (Basically a walkthrough, but in the game itself.)
- Pre-Credits Text (See "Credits.txt")
- New title screen with much explosions
- Easy Mode with "Hard Part Skipper"
- Making a serious game. That means: Turn cheats off (except Air-Move on B), remove all non-main level, etc...
