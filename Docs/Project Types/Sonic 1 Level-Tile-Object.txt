This type of project allows for editing tiles/blocks/chunks, level
layout, and object layout for Sonic 1.

Type setting is 1. Zone and Act IDs should be set to the Zone/Act this
level will occupy when it is inserted into the game. Those values assist
in managing data such as object def subentries. The Object Def file
listed should contain the data for the objects used by the game that
this project will be inserted to. The Object Def filename listed in this
file SHOULD NOT have an extension. The program adds the extension itself
to build the Object Def filename and it's art file's filename, and if an
extension is already present, the filenames will become invalid and will
not load. All other filenames listed in this file should contain their
full name, including the extension.

Required data are all three tile sizes, layout for foreground (plane A)
and background (plane B), object locations, palette (which are usually
split into "main" and "level" palettes), the angle array, the collision
map array, it's rotated counterpart, and the current level's collision
map index listing.

Palettes are loaded by specifying how many colors are in the requested
palette file, and which palette index to begin inserting them at.
"Underwater" or other "accessory" palettes may be loaded by loading a
palette file into indicies 64 through 127.

An example is as follows. Please replace the data given in this example
with the appropriate data required to load the desired files:
