# Sonic ERaZor source code
This is the full source code to Sonic ERaZor 8.1, the most recent version of the game released in 2025.

Do note that, despite my best attempts to modernize this game, it is still essentially a 15-years-old ROM hack. A lot of what you see here is therefore incredibly outdated and/or poorly coded to begin with. You have been warned. Apart from that you are free to do whatever you want with this stuff. All I ask for is that you refrain from taking any music, as that was all done by other (way more talented) people.

Also don't steal without giving credits lol
