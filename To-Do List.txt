To-Do:
- Find new music for Night Hill Place.
- Finding new Title Screen background art.
- Find a new option (right now it's marked as XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX in the options screen and does nothing).
- Redo the credits text (it would be better to just make a complete new credits system though).
- Make a $ in the style of my current font (for the sound test in the options menu).
- Doing Info Screen Textes for MZ and LZ.

Bugs:
- The Sonic 3 art is sometimes broken.

Would be great:
- Find a more accurate system for the palette-restoration from WhiteFlash.
- For Camera Shaking I used an object... WHAT THE HELL WAS I THINKING??? This should be replaced by something... normal.

Ideas:
- Blood impact when being hit.
- Challenge: Race against Sonic's shadow. (i.e. Rayman - Candy Chateau)
- Demo Mode. (Basically a walkthrough, but in the game itself.)
- Add explosions to the title screen.
- Easy Mode with "Hard Part Skipper".
