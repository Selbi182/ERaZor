To-Do:
- The Star Light Update:
	- Find a concept and implent it (easier said than done).
	- Find a proper name for the stage, create the sign, write the new story text, and make an "Act 7" art.

- Implant Markey's improved palette fade out.
- Rewrite most of the embarrasing story texts and maybe redo its entire art to be more appealing.
- Work a little on the credits again (slowdown and new font).


Bugs:
- Fix the "2 Crameats on Spindash" bug.
