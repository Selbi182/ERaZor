Types of Spikes:
	Predefined speed in a set direction:
Y		<     >	= Level 1 ($0200)
Y		<<   >>	= Level 2 ($0400)
Y		<<< >>>	= Level 3 ($0800)
N		X	= Explodes on contact (one time use; push force of red spring ($1000))
	
	Speed-relative spikes:
N		0	= Neutral (don't affect the speed at all)
	[	+	= Increase speed by 50%	]
Y		.5	= Halve speed
Y-		¬	= Negate speed (usually a horizontal spike)

	Addendums (can be applied additionally):
	[	*	= Ghost (only becomes solid after having passed through once)	]
