[quote name='Selbi, a few days before he started to work on this update,'][I]I'm just going to add a level and do one or two bug fixes. Should be done in a week.[/I][/quote]
And now I sit here, almost 8 months later, writing down this topic. It would've been even longer if something back in May didn't suddenly make me finish my work. It looked like I could be done by June, but problems made me delay it almost by yet another month.

[size="3"][b]About this update:[/b][/size]

This version, originally titled '[I]The SLZ Update[/I]', turned out into something I had never expected. An overview of the most important changes:

[list][*]Added 3 new levels, of which one is a special one.
[*]Added 2 new bosses.
[*]Remixed or added many new songs.
[*]Rewrote all story texts - now featuring more terrible humor.
[*]Added a system so people will no longer have an excuse for being bad.
[*]Added too much unnecessary extras throughout the game.
[*]Fixed more bugs, exploits, and graphical elements than you could imagine.
[*]Secrets...[/list]

I will leave you at this because I don't want to spoil anyone too much.

All I can give you are some of the screenshots I've already posted in various other threads before, because, once again, spoilers should be kept at a minimum:

As well as DalekSam's teaser trailer video he created a few weeks after I started working on the update. That means the content of this video is incredibly outdated, but it's still worth a watch:
