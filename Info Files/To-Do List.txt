To-Do:
- The Star Light Update:
	- Find a concept and implement it (easier said than done). (Update: Concept (sorta) found!)
	- Find a proper name for the stage, create the sign, write the new story text, and create the new chapter screen.

- Rewrite most of the embarrasing story texts and maybe redo its entire art to be more appealing. Also increase its speed.
- Redesign "Finalor Place" to at least get rid of that grey background in the boss area. Making it longer wouldn't harm either.
- A new life icon. That crazed Sonic is really starting to piss me off.
- Finish (and actually create) the new Eggman/Bomb cutscene.
- Finish Tutorial Level (see Intro Script.txt).

- Create a straight version of the finished product if necessary (or even combine both).


Ideas:
- More cutscenes.
- The S-Monitor should get a new level that solely is made for it (in a positive way, so completely unlike to Ruined Place).
