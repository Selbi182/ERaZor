ERaZor SLZ Concept:

The level is divided into 4 different sections (though section 2 and 3 are supposed to be the important ones, especially 3) and, unlike previous levels, is going to include a heavy in-game story line revolving around the walking
bomb enemy, which is also going to have a cutscene before the level starts, in which you can see Robotnik manufacturing them. Gameplay-wise, SLZ will be similar to Ruined Place, starting off normally and then going over to a 
completely unique challenge.

Section 1 (Introduction):
	- The first section plays like 'normal' Sonic ERaZor levels - tough challenges and fast paced action. It introduces the bomb enemy and is supposed to be a serious threat, so the player will know how important their role is.
	- Apart from that, nothing special is supposed to happen. This section acts mostly as a filler for the other two sections and shouldn't be too long.

Section 2 (Mini Boss Fight):
	- Sonic will break through a wall (from the top) and land into a room with one of these bombs. The room can't be escaped. The bomb is supposed to be a mini boss, not unlike the Crabmeat in Night Hill Place.
	- This bomb is different; it shoots more pellets upon destruction, takes less time to explode, and walks faster. However, this means after a certain time it'll run out of energy and get a malfunction, blowing up entirely in
	  a massive explosion.
	- Unfortunately, this fight takes in the room responsible for the artificial gravity, which now gets completely messed up.
	- The bomb didn't fully explode, so now Sonic collects what's left over and continues (these are secret codes, needed to enter SBZ).

Section 3 (Gravity Control):
	- Due to the gravity problems, Sonic is now able to jump much higher.
	- Additionally (and this is going to be main aspect of this section), he can fly by 'controlling his gravity' or even reversing it altogether, but it's gonna cost him a lot of energy. I'm not sure if I'm going to use
	  special monitors and add something like a 'flying bar' to the HUD, or simply consuming rings.
	- It's going to be somewhat similar to Ruined Place, navigating through a dangerous labyrinth with time pressure. Failure sends you back to a checkpoint.
	- However, this time you have a lot more control over what you are doing and also a much larger area to play in. The path is still set, but it's going to take up much more space (after all, you are in something like space).
	- Because artificial gravity was needed to keep this place stable, shit is going down. As it's true to any ERaZor level, explosions everywhere.
	- After going through the level, Sonic will from time to time experience 'gravity pushes', in which he is unable to control in which direction he wants to go, due to the broken gravity in general. Think of Special Stage 2.

Section 4 (Finish):
	- It's just a small platform with the finish post.
	- MAYBE I will do a cutscene where Sonic analyses the bot's gibs and finds the hidden codes to SBZ, which he then takes to go into there.
	- Meanwhile, the artificial gravity is working again and everything's fine again.
