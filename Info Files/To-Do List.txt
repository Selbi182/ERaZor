To-Do:
- The Star Light Update:
	- Finish post-boss-level (where the gravity thing is).
	- Write the new story text.
	- Create art for the machine in the Eggman/Bomb cutscene.
	
- Finish Tutorial Level by creating the info boxes (see Intro Script.txt).
- Rewrite most of the embarrasing story texts and maybe redo its entire art to be more appealing. Also increase its speed.
