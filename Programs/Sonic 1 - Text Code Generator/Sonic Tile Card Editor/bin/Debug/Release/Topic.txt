'''Sonic 1 - Text Code Generator''' (or simply S1TCG) is a text editing tool, which generates normal [[ASCII]] characters to Zone and Credits Title Card [[Sprite mappings]] for Sonic 1 Split [[Disassemblies]] ([http://info.sonicretro.org/images/5/5f/Sonic_1_%28Split_and_Text_by_Hivebrain%29_%28ASM68K%29.zip Hivebrain June 2005 version] only). It was created by [[Selbi]] and was written in Visual Basic 2008, which requires .NET Framework v3.0 or better. The latest version of the tool (v2.0) is also aviable to do [[Level Select]] Text (though it's just a temporary solution).
