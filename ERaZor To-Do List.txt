Bugs:
- Restore music after death, if it isn't the normal music.

Would be great:
- Find an more accurate system for the palette-restoration from WhiteFlash.
- Find better graphics for the title screen.

Ideas:
- Challenge: Race against Sonic's shadow.
- Demo Mode (Basically a walkthrough through the game.)
- Pre-Credits Text (Credits.txt)
- New title screen with much explosions.
- Easy Mode with "Hard Part Skipper"
- Making a serious game. That means: Turn cheats off (except Air-Move on B), remove all non-main level, etc...
