(MORE SCREENSHOTS HERE)

A massive quality-of-life update for every single aspect of the game! Many, many design improvements – both visually and gameplay-wise – as well as another metric fuckton of bugfixes.
The goal was to keep the identity as faithful to the OG version as possible while acknowledging its shortcomings.

Stop me if you've heard this one before: "Final version of Sonic ERaZor." Yeah, we're beating that dead horse once again, though this time it's at least been a while – 8 years since the last release, to be precise. Don't get me wrong, I really do mean I originally had no plans to work on it again. Hell, [URL='https://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?threads/sonic-erazor-source-code-and-everything-else.41682/']I even made the source code public[/URL]. But then something happened – that's right, [URL='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaIDlHM3qC4']redhotsonic happened[/URL]. While I did spot the odd bug or design quirk here and there over the past few years already, it was his video – specifically the showcase of a massive, unavoidable hard crash if the game ran without SRAM – that finally made me break my oath. So, uh, thanks? :v:

But after almost a decade of silence, I didn't want to release a new version only containing a single bug fix. One thing led to another and suddenly this revival grew into its own beast. A lovely beast, though; I haven't been this excited about anything tech-related in actual ages. It is genuinely a great feeling to look at the clock and see it's already 3 a.m. because I got so lost in the zone while working on something I'm passionate about. I missed that feeling. If there's anything you might want to take away from this sappy ramble, it's this: don't worry about dusting off the ol' reliable. If working on it makes you happy, that's all that matters.

[I]Ahem.[/I] Now that we're done with the lore recap, I'm delighted to talk about the update itself. Originally, I wanted to post the full changelog, but uh... then you'd look at 300-something entries.

So, here is the basic overview of the update:
[LIST]
[*][B]Full compatibility with real hardware[/B]! Yes, even without SRAM.
[*][B]Casual/Frantic Mode[/B]: A new difficulty selection screen, but not in the traditional sense of "easy/hard". This one is more about how you prefer to play the game; do you want to take your time or do you want to be constantly pushed forward through time pressure? They choice is yours!
[*]Some ideas of the old version just didn't work out like I had hoped they would, so [B]a ton of challenges have been dramatically altered to feel more fun[/B]
[*]In general, every level received some form of major overhaul to [B]tackle long-standing gameplay issues and visual quirks[/B]
[*]Added [B]"Skip Story Texts"[/B] and [B]"Skip Uberhub"[/B] options, for that authentic playthrough-in-one-sitting-without-interruptions experience
[*]Everything text-related received some form of [B]rewrite or visual overhaul[/B]
[*][B]Reduced the intensity of all flashing lights[/B]. No more epilepsy warning necessary, dear YouTubers
[*]Fancy new and improved [B]black bars[/B] to be more cinematic
[*][B]A new unlockable option[/B]
[*][B]Tons of easter eggs[/B]
[*]And a plethora of bug fixes and general quality-of-life improvements...
[/LIST]

I want to give my most sincere appreciation to everyone in the ERaZor 7 squad. Without you guys, this update would've been impossible:
[LIST]
[*][B]vladikcomper[/B]: The master of blast processing! He helped me out when I hit a severe technical roadblock that almost put the whole project into jeopardy. He also optimized a ton about the engine and implemented MegaPCM 2!
[*][B]MarkeyJester[/B]: My mentor for as long as ERaZor has existed, and he continued to be an amazing teacher for this update as well! Oh yeah and he also drew a nuke.
[*][B]Fuzzy[/B]: A long-time fan-turned-friend who joined with the unique skillset of a programmer while also being very familiar with the base game. An invaluable resource for making ERaZor even more ERaZor-y!
[*][B]SonicFan1[/B]: Doing a tooon of hardware testing and provided great feedback for almost any wild idea I had. In fact, he was my sanity check for when I went a bit too crazy.
[*][B]ajcox[/B]: He did a ton of playtesting in video format, which helped uncover some of the most bizarre bugs by doing stuff I would've never thought of. Also super helpful with ideas and feedback!
[*][B]neonsynth[/B] aka. SonicVaan: The guy who made the original six versions playable returned to beta test this update as well for old time's sake!
[*][B]Peanut Noceda[/B]: He helped me a lot in the early stages of the update project.
[*][B]Give[/B] and [B]Craze[/B]: Additional one-time playtesting mid-development, to get input from a fresh perspective.
